## **Bash Cheat Sheet // Things to Remember (If not thats OK... I think)**
1. cd :(_To change directories either with an absolute path or relative_)
    > * cd ~ :(_Goes back to your **home** directory_)
    > * cd . :(_Stays in the current directory_)
    > * cd .. :(_Moves up an directory_)
    > * cd ~/DirectHere/DirectHere :(_You can move into another directory quickly using this method_)

2. ls :(_List of files in the current directory_)

3. pwd :(_Shows current directory_)

4. mkdir (Name(**Without parentheses _DUH_!**)) :(_Creates a new file in the current directory_)
    > * rmdir (Name) :(_Removes the directory **DIRECTORY MUST BE EMPTY!**_)

5. touch (Name) :(_Creates an empty file_)
    > * cp (Name) :(_Copies a file || directory_)
    > * mv (Name) :(_Moves || Renames a file || directory_)
    > * rm (Name) :(_Deletes a file_)

### **These are the main Bash commands that're to be remembered. There are many more and different combinations of commands. Such as** _git_!
